Modelling chromatin as a Gaussian spring
$$k = \frac{3k_B T}{\langle R^2 \rangle}$$
$$\langle R^2 \rangle = 2 L_P L_C$$
$$\tilde k = \frac{3k_B T}{\langle R^2 \rangle} \frac{1}{\alpha (c_0/\bar c)^4}$$
The free energy functional $F$ was non-dimensionalized using the energy scale $[E]$
$$F = \iint dx dy \alpha(c-c_0)^4 \cdots$$
$$[E]=\alpha (c_0/\bar c)^4 [L]^2$$
Using the end-to-end distance to estimate the rest length
$$\langle R^2 \rangle=\tilde d ^2 [L]^2=2 L_PL_C$$
$$\tilde k = \frac{3k_B T}{\tilde d^2 [L^2]} \frac{1}{\alpha (c_0/\bar c)^4}$$
$$\tilde k = \frac{3k_B T}{[E]}\frac{1}{\tilde d^2}$$
The energy scale depends on the critical temperature and light or dense phase concentrations of nuclear proteins as well as the diffusivity and degradation (consumption) rate of nascent RNA.
$$\tilde k \propto \frac{1}{\tilde d^2}$$
Cohesin shortens the contour length of chromatin, decreasing $\tilde d$. Chromatin moves along the contour of this curve.
