varied:
    - seed concentration = make droplet smaller
    - rna production rate = make droplet flow and not dissolve/renucleate
    - surface tension = make droplet morph less
    - location = phase diagram
conclusion
    - seed concentration has a negligible effect on total amount of protein, and a
    better variable to control would be the background concentration
    - interesting behaviours occur for production rate between 0.01 and 1.0
        - 1.0 is too large of a production rate, leading to dissolution/renucleation
        - 0.01 is too small of a production rate, low gradient
    - it is unclear to me how to explain what reaction sigma does, increasing sigma increases condensate size
    - i do not observe the vacuoles that Pradeep did, need to compare with their parameters
